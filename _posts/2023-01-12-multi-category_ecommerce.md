#### Consequence of the project
**It is necessary to understand the customers who purchase high-involvement products and to devise a marketing strategy**

- Although it is a shopping mall that sells multi-categories, the categories that customers actually purchase are high-involvement products such as electronic products and electronic furniture
- Need to cluster with RFM + I (involvement), and develop marketing strategy according to customer tendency
  - For customers with a long navigation process ➡ cautious customers: need to provide a lot of information
  - For customers with a short navigation process ➡ customers with quick decisions: only key information needs to be prominently provided
- Since users have already recognized that it is a good platform for purchasing electronic products, a strategy to further specialize the UI by providing convenient functions for purchasing electronic products is effective
- When competitors who sell multicategories, such as Amazon, already have an edge in the market, focusing on a specific category is a way to attract new users
- Since high-involvement products do not have a high frequency of purchase, it is important to not only increase the number of users, but also to continuously update the shopping mall so that it can be used for a long time to secure LTV



#### Self-assessment
**Regrets, learnings and achievements**

- In the case of multi-category sales, it would be possible to determine at the EDA level whether a particular category was selling the most.
- If I had used Tablo from the beginning, the EDA process would have been faster.
- I don't use statistics much, so I concluded what anyone with a lot of domain knowledge would have already known.
- If we had targeted users with at least one purchase history from the beginning, the clustering steps would have been reduced
- The increase in data size from October (5GB) to November (9GB) can be expected to indicate an increase in users, but it would be a mistake to judge that the number of events decreased in November. It would have been nice to include not only the number of users, but also a certain percentage of the total data collected and compare them
- When visualizing in PowerPoint, using Excel and PowerPoint charts is easier and faster than Matthew and Seaborn.
- Succeeded in sampling
- Persona setting logic is appropriate
- I discovered the possibility of wasting inventory costs and suggested the strategic direction of the shopping mall.
